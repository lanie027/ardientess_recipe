            <li>In a bowl, combine beef, lemon juice, soy sauce, sliced onions, garlic, and pepper. Massage marinade into the meat and marinate for about 30 minutes. </li>
            <li>Remove meat, onions, and garlic from marinade, squeezing and reserving excess liquid.</li>
            <li>In a pan over high heat, heat oil. Add beef and cook for about 3 to 5 minutes per side or until lightly browned. Spoon out and reserve released meat juices during frying. Remove meat.</li>
            <li>In the pan,  add onions and garlic, and cook, stirring regularly, until softened. Return browned beef to pan.</li>
            <li>Add reserved marinade and meat juices. Add water and bring to a boil. </li>
            <li>Cover, lower heat, and simmer for about 40 to 50 minutes or until meat is fork-tender and liquid is reduced. Season with salt to taste. </li>
            <li>Turn off heat. Garnish with onion rings, if desired, and cover to allow onions to cook slightly in the steam. Serve.</li>
