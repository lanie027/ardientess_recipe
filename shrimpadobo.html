        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <p>2 teaspoons vegetable oil</p>
            <p>12.4 ounces shrimp</p>
            <p>0.3 ounces garlic (1 very large clove)</p>
            <p>1/4 cup apple cider vinegar</p>
            <p>2 tablespoons soy sauce</p>
            <p>1 teaspoon coconut sugar</p>
            <p>1 bay leaves</p>
            <p>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</p>
            <p>scallions (for garnish)</p>
            
        </ul>
        <h3>Procedures</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a frying pan until hot. Add the vegetable oil and swirl to coat the pan.</li>
            <li>Add the garlic and shrimp and spread into a single layer. When the shrimp start to brown, flip it over and sear until it's almost (but not completely) cooked through. Transfer the shrimp to a bowl and set aside.</li>
            <li>Add the apple cider vinegar, soy sauce, coconut sugar, bay leaves and ground black pepper to the pan and bring the sauce to a boil. Continue boiling until the sauce has reduced and is nice and thick.</li>
            <li>Add the shrimp back in and toss to coat.</li>
            <li>Serve the shrimp adobo on top of hot white rice garnished with chopped scallions.</li>
        </ol>
